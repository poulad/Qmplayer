# Qmplayer
This project is a media player(both video and audio) which illustrates the usage of a custom widget called QmplayerWidget, an object of type QWidget that wraps mplayer, as backend. You can simply add a QWidget object to your form and promote it to a QmplayerWidget.
If mplayer binary doesn't exist in PATH environment variable, you can give its path to the widget.
